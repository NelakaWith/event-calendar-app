## API Base URL Configuration

- The API base URL is set via `client/.env` using the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable.
- For Netlify production, set:
  ```
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.up.railway.app
  ```
- For local development with a separate backend, set:
  ```
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
  ```
- All API calls use relative URLs for environment-agnostic deployment.

---

## Netlify Integration

- The frontend is built and published from `client/dist`.
- All `/api/*` requests are proxied to the Railway-hosted backend API.
- Netlify auto-deploys on merge to `main`.

---

## Notes

- Update API endpoints in your code to match your backend server if needed.
- You can add more routes and components as your app grows.
- For Netlify, ensure your `.env` is set up for the correct environment.

## Prop Naming Convention

In all Vue components, prop names are defined in camelCase in the `<script>` section (e.g., `initialTitle`) and should be referenced in templates using kebab-case (e.g., `:initial-title="..."`).

Vue automatically normalizes these, so both work, but following this convention improves code readability and consistency for all contributors.
