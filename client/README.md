```

The app will run at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## API Base URL Configuration

- The API base URL is set via `client/.env` using the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` variable.
- For Netlify dev/serverless, set:
  ```
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=/
  ```
- For local development with a separate backend, set:
  ```
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
  ```
- All API calls use relative URLs for environment-agnostic deployment.

---

## Netlify Integration

- The frontend is built and published from `client/dist`.
- All `/api/*` requests are proxied to the Netlify serverless function as configured in `netlify.toml`.
- Works seamlessly with the serverless Express backend.

---

## Notes

- Update API endpoints in your code to match your backend server if needed.
- You can add more routes and components as your app grows.
- For Netlify, ensure your `.env` is set up for the correct environment.
